### Examples of depth estimation by the proposed method
![example1](./examples/fig1.png)
From top to bottom: input color images, ground truth, and estimation results by the proposed method. Note that left two samples are from the KITTI dataset while right ones belong to the NYU Depth V2 dataset.

### Experimental results with state-of-the art methods on the KITTI dataset
